There are two ways of transfering data from controller to view. 

1. The Model Class method
2. The ModelAndView Class method

The model class method uses addAttribute() method to get the names of attributes that we have to transfer to view.
The ModelAndView Class method uses addObject() method to add the names of attributes that we have to transfer to view.
